# 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
An introductory project on:

- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables
# Requirements
- no global variable
- Files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- no standard library functions, except otherwise stated
- allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
# File Descriptions
## Mandatory
[0-reset_to_98.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c) - function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.

[1-swap.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c) - function that swaps the values of two integers.

[2-strlen.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c) - function that returns the length of a string.

[3-puts.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c) - function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.

[4-print_rev.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c) - function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

[5-rev_string.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c) - function that reverses a string.

[6-puts2.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6-puts2.c) - function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

[7-puts_half.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7-puts_half.c) - function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

[8-print_array.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c) - function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

[9-strcpy.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c) - function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

## Advanced
[100-atoi.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/100-atoi.c) - converts a string to an integer.

[101-keygen.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/101-keygen.c) - generates random valid passwords for the program `101-crackme`.

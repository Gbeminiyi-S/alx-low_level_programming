# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
An introductory project on:

- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

# Requirements
- no global variable
- files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- the only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden.
- allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)

# File Descriptions
## Mandatory
[0-binary_to_uint.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi2022/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/0-binary_to_uint.c) - converts a binary number to an unsigned `int`.

[1-print_binary.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi2022/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/1-print_binary.c) - prints the binary representation of a number.

[2-get_bit.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi2022/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/2-get_bit.c) - returns the value of a bit at a given index.

[3-set_bit.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi2022/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/3-set_bit.c) - sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

[4-clear_bit.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi2022/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/4-clear_bit.c) - sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

[5-flip_bits.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi2022/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/5-flip_bits.c) - returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
## Advanced
[100-get_endianness.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi2022/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/100-get_endianness.c) - checks the endianness.

# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
An introductory project on:

- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables
# Requirements
- no global variable
- Files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- no standard library functions, except otherwise stated
- allowed to use [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
# File Descriptions
## Mandatory
[0-memset.c](./0-memset.c) - fills memory with a constant byte.

[1-memcpy.c](./1-memcpy.c) - copies memory area.

[2-strchr.c](./2-strchr.c) - locates a character in a string.

[3-strspn.c](./3-strspn.c) - gets the length of a prefix substring.

[4-strpbrk.c](./4-strpbrk.c) - searches a string for any of a set of bytes. 

[5-strstr.c](./5-strstr.c) - locates a substring

[7-print_chessboard.c](./7-print_chessboard.c) - prints the chessboard.

[8-print_diagsums.c](./8-print_diagsums.c) - prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

## Advanced
[100-set_string.c](./100-set_string.c) - sets the value of a pointer to a char.

[101-crackme_password](./101-crackme_password) - a file that contains the password for the [crackme2](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x06.c) executable.
